# R-course-2021
Course taught in 4 parts: 
1. Introduction to tidy data and `dplyr`
2. Statistical testing part 1 (correlations and linear regreesions)
3. Statistical testing part 2 (mixed effect models)
4. Data visualization with `ggplot2`

I created the slides using [xarigan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) and the [R-ladies css](https://github.com/rladies/resources/blob/master/xaringan-slides/how_to_use.md). The PDFs were generated from html files using the following code: `pagedown::chrome_print("test.html",output="test.pdf")`.
